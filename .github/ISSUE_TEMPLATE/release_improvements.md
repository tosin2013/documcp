# Release Pipeline Improvement Issues

## 🚀 Critical Improvements

### Issue 1: Fix npm Package Publishing

**Title:** Verify and fix npm package publishing configuration
**Priority:** High
**Labels:** bug, release, npm

**Problem:**
The release workflow is configured to publish to npm, but the package "documcp" is not found on the npm registry, indicating either publication failures or configuration issues.

**Solution:**

1. Verify NPM_TOKEN secret configuration in GitHub repository secrets
2. Test npm publication locally with dry-run
3. Add publication verification step to release workflow
4. Implement fallback handling for publication failures

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] npm package "documcp" is publicly accessible on npm registry
- [ ] Release workflow successfully publishes new versions
- [ ] Publication failures are properly logged and handled

### Issue 2: Automated Changelog Generation

**Title:** Implement automated changelog generation from commits
**Priority:** High
**Labels:** enhancement, automation, documentation

**Problem:**
Changelog updates are currently manual, leading to potential inconsistencies and missed entries.

**Solution:**

1. Implement conventional commits standard
2. Add automated changelog generation tool (e.g., standard-version, semantic-release)
3. Integrate with release workflow
4. Add commit validation

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Changelog automatically updated on release
- [ ] Commit messages follow conventional format
- [ ] Release notes include all relevant changes

### Issue 3: Improve Test Coverage to 85%

**Title:** Increase test coverage to meet 85% target threshold
**Priority:** High
**Labels:** testing, quality, coverage

**Problem:**
Current test coverage (82.59%) is below the 85% target, particularly in critical files.

**Solution:**

1. Focus on files with <60% coverage first
2. Add comprehensive tests for error handling
3. Improve branch coverage
4. Add integration tests

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Overall statement coverage ≥85%
- [ ] No files with <70% coverage
- [ ] Critical business logic fully tested
