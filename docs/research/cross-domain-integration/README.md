## Integration Patterns

### Repository Analysis → SSG Recommendation

- Analysis results directly inform SSG scoring
- Technology stack detection influences SSG selection
- Project complexity affects recommendation confidence
- Historical patterns enhance recommendation accuracy

### SSG Recommendation → Documentation Generation

- SSG choice determines documentation structure
- SSG capabilities influence content generation strategies
- Configuration templates are SSG-specific
- Deployment workflows are optimized per SSG

### Documentation Generation → Deployment

- Generated content is optimized for deployment target
- Configuration files are deployment-ready
- Deployment workflows are automatically configured
- Monitoring and verification are deployment-specific

### Memory System Integration

- All domains contribute to and benefit from memory
- Historical patterns improve all domain performance
- User preferences influence all domain behavior
- Cross-domain learning enhances system intelligence

## Workflow Optimization

### Complete Workflows

```bash
# Complete documentation workflow
"analyze my repository, recommend SSG, generate documentation, and deploy"
```

This workflow integrates:

1. Repository analysis with memory enhancement
2. SSG recommendation based on analysis and memory
3. Documentation generation optimized for chosen SSG
4. Deployment with monitoring and verification

### Error Handling

- Errors in one domain don't break the entire workflow
- Graceful degradation when components are unavailable
- Clear error messages with recovery suggestions
- Rollback capabilities for failed operations

### Performance Optimization

- Parallel processing where possible
- Caching across domain boundaries
- Optimized data structures for cross-domain use
- Minimal data serialization overhead

## System Architecture
