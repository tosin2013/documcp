# Static Site Generator Performance Analysis

**Research Date**: 2025-01-14  
**Domain**: SSG Recommendation Engine  
**Status**: Completed

## Research Overview

Comprehensive analysis of static site generator performance characteristics, build times, and deployment considerations for DocuMCP recommendation engine.

## Key Research Findings

### Build Performance Comparison

Based on CSS-Tricks comprehensive benchmarking study:

| SSG            | Language | Small Sites (1-1024 files)        | Large Sites (1K-64K files)      | Key Characteristics             |
| -------------- | -------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Hugo**       | Go       | ~250x faster than Gatsby          | ~40x faster than Gatsby         | Fastest across all scales       |
| **Jekyll**     | Ruby     | Competitive with Eleventy         | Slower scaling, Ruby bottleneck | Good for small-medium sites     |
| **Eleventy**   | Node.js  | Fast, lightweight                 | Good scaling                    | Excellent developer experience  |
| **Gatsby**     | React    | Slower startup (webpack overhead) | Improves relatively at scale    | Rich features, plugin ecosystem |
| **Next.js**    | React    | Framework overhead                | Good with optimization          | Hybrid capabilities             |
| **Docusaurus** | React    | Moderate performance              | Documentation optimized         | Purpose-built for docs          |

### Performance Characteristics Analysis

#### **Tier 1: Speed Champions (Hugo)**

- **Build Time**: Sub-second for small sites, seconds for large sites
- **Scaling**: Linear performance, excellent for content-heavy sites
- **Trade-offs**: Limited plugin ecosystem, steeper learning curve

#### **Tier 2: Balanced Performance (Jekyll, Eleventy)**

- **Build Time**: Fast for small sites, moderate scaling
- **Scaling**: Jekyll hits Ruby performance ceiling, Eleventy scales better
- **Trade-offs**: Good balance of features and performance

#### **Tier 3: Feature-Rich (Gatsby, Next.js, Docusaurus)**

- **Build Time**: Significant webpack/framework overhead
- **Scaling**: Performance gap narrows at scale due to optimizations
- **Trade-offs**: Rich ecosystems, modern features, slower builds

### Real-World Performance Implications

#### **For DocuMCP Recommendation Logic:**

1. **Small Projects** (< 100 pages):

   - All SSGs perform adequately
   - Developer experience becomes primary factor
   - Hugo still 250x faster than Gatsby for simple sites

2. **Medium Projects** (100-1000 pages):

   - Performance differences become noticeable
   - Hugo maintains significant advantage
   - Jekyll starts showing Ruby limitations

3. **Large Projects** (1000+ pages):
   - Hugo remains fastest but gap narrows
   - Framework-based SSGs benefit from optimizations
   - Build time becomes CI/CD bottleneck consideration

### Deployment and CI/CD Considerations

#### **GitHub Actions Build Time Impact**

- **Free Plan Limitations**: 2000 minutes/month
- **Cost Implications**: Slow builds consume more CI time
- **Real Example**: Gatsby site taking 15 minutes vs Hugo taking 30 seconds

#### **Content Editor Experience**

- **Preview Generation**: Fast builds enable quick content previews
- **Development Workflow**: Build speed affects local development experience
- **Incremental Builds**: Framework support varies significantly

### Recommendation Engine Criteria

Based on research findings, DocuMCP should weight these factors:

1. **Project Scale Weight**:

   - Small projects: 40% performance, 60% features/DX
   - Medium projects: 60% performance, 40% features/DX
   - Large projects: 80% performance, 20% features/DX

2. **Team Context Multipliers**:

   - Technical team: Favor performance (Hugo/Eleventy)
   - Non-technical content creators: Favor ease-of-use (Jekyll/Docusaurus)
   - Mixed teams: Balanced approach (Next.js/Gatsby)

3. **Use Case Optimization**:
   - **Documentation**: Docusaurus > MkDocs > Hugo
   - **Marketing Sites**: Next.js > Gatsby > Hugo
   - **Blogs**: Jekyll > Eleventy > Hugo
   - **Large Content Sites**: Hugo > Eleventy > Others

## Implementation Recommendations for DocuMCP

### Algorithm Design

```typescript
// Performance scoring algorithm
const calculatePerformanceScore = (projectMetrics: ProjectMetrics) => {
  const { pageCount, teamSize, techLevel, updateFrequency } = projectMetrics;

  // Scale-based performance weighting
  const performanceWeight =
    pageCount > 1000 ? 0.8 : pageCount > 100 ? 0.6 : 0.4;

  // SSG-specific performance scores (0-100)
  const performanceScores = {
    hugo: 100,
    eleventy: 85,
    jekyll: pageCount > 500 ? 60 : 80,
    nextjs: 70,
    gatsby: pageCount > 1000 ? 65 : 45,
    docusaurus: 75,
  };

  return performanceScores;
};
```

### Research Validation

- ✅ Performance benchmarks analyzed from multiple sources
- ✅ Real-world implications documented
- ✅ Recommendation criteria established
- ⚠️ Needs validation: Edge case performance scenarios
- ⚠️ Needs testing: Algorithm implementation with real project data
