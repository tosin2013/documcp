# Domain 2: Repository Analysis Research

This directory contains research and analysis related to DocuMCP's repository analysis engine.

## Research Areas

### Multi-layered Analysis

- **File System Analysis**: Directory structure, file types, organization patterns
- **Dependency Analysis**: Package dependencies, version compatibility, security
- **Code Quality Analysis**: Complexity metrics, testing coverage, documentation
- **Technology Stack Detection**: Framework identification, tool usage patterns

### Analysis Algorithms

- **Pattern Recognition**: Common project structures and configurations
- **Technology Detection**: Framework and library identification
- **Complexity Assessment**: Project size and complexity metrics
