## ADR Process

This project follows the Architectural Decision Record (ADR) process as defined by Michael Nygard. Each ADR documents a significant architectural decision made during the project's development.

### ADR Template

Each ADR follows a consistent structure:

- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context**: The situation and requirements that led to the decision
- **Decision**: The actual architectural decision made
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were evaluated
- **Consequences**: Positive and negative outcomes of the decision
- **Implementation Details**: Technical specifics and code examples where relevant

### Decision Categories

Our ADRs are organized into the following categories:

#### Foundation Architecture (ADRs 001-002)

- Core server architecture and technology choices
- Repository analysis engine design

#### Intelligence & Recommendation (ADRs 003)

- Static site generator recommendation algorithms
- Decision-making frameworks

#### Content & Structure (ADRs 004, 008, 009)

- Documentation framework integration
- Information architecture decisions
- Intelligent content population and generation
- Content accuracy and validation frameworks

#### Deployment & Integration (ADRs 005-006)

- GitHub Pages deployment automation
- MCP tools API design

#### AI & Assistance (ADR 007)

- MCP prompts and resources for guided workflows

## Key Architectural Principles

Based on our ADRs, DocuMCP follows these core architectural principles:

### 1. **Methodological Pragmatism**

- Evidence-based decision making with explicit confidence scoring
- Systematic verification processes for all recommendations
- Clear acknowledgment of limitations and uncertainty

### 2. **Standards Compliance**

- Full adherence to MCP specification requirements
- Industry best practices for static site generation
- Proven frameworks like Diataxis for information architecture

### 3. **Modular Design**

- Clear separation of concerns between analysis, recommendation, generation, and deployment
- Extensible architecture supporting future enhancements
- Stateless operation for consistency and reliability

### 4. **Intelligent Automation**

- Deep repository analysis for informed decision making
- Context-aware configuration generation
- Performance-optimized deployment workflows

### 5. **Developer Experience**

- Intuitive MCP tools API with comprehensive validation
- Clear error messages and troubleshooting guidance
- Progressive complexity from simple to advanced use cases

## Decision Timeline

The ADRs were developed during the planning phase of DocuMCP, establishing the architectural foundation before implementation. The decisions build upon each other:

1. **Foundation** (ADR-001): Established TypeScript/MCP SDK as the core platform
2. **Analysis** (ADR-002): Defined multi-layered repository analysis approach
3. **Intelligence** (ADR-003): Specified recommendation engine architecture
4. **Structure** (ADR-004): Integrated Diataxis framework for quality documentation
5. **Deployment** (ADR-005): Designed automated GitHub Pages deployment system
6. **Interface** (ADR-006): Specified comprehensive MCP tools API

## Confidence and Validation

Each ADR includes confidence assessments and validation strategies:

- **High Confidence Decisions**: Technology choices with strong ecosystem support (TypeScript/MCP SDK)
- **Medium Confidence Decisions**: Framework integrations with proven track records (Diataxis)
- **Validated Assumptions**: Architectural patterns tested through prototype development
- **Risk Mitigation**: Explicit identification and mitigation strategies for each decision

## Future Considerations

Our ADRs acknowledge areas for future evolution:

- **Machine Learning Integration**: Potential for AI-powered content analysis and recommendations
- **Performance Optimization**: WebAssembly modules for intensive analysis operations
- **Extended SSG Support**: Community-contributed static site generator profiles
- **Advanced Deployment**: Multi-environment and blue-green deployment capabilities
